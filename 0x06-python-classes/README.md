# Classes and Objects

Project completed during **Fullstack Software Engineering** program at **ALX**. It aims to learn about object oriented programming (OOP), classes, objects, instances, methods and attributes in **Python**.

## Technologies
* Python Scripts are written with Python
* C files are compiled using GCC
* Tested on Ubuntu
