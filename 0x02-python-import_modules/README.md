# Import & modules
Project completed during **Fullstack Software Engineering** studies at **ALX**. It aims to learn how to import functions, how to create modules and how to use command line arguments in **Python**.

## Technologies
* Shell Scripts are written in Bash
* Python Scripts are written with Python
* C files are compiled using GCC
* Tested on Ubuntu
