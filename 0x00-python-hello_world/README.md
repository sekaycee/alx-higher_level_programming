# Hello, World
Project completed during my **Fullstack Software Engineering** studies at **ALX**.
It aims to learn about variables, basic commands like print and string handling with **Python**.

## Technologies
* Shell Scripts are written with Bash
* Python Scripts are written with Python3
* C Files are compiled using GCC
* Tested on Ubuntu
